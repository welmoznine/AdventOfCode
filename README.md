# 🎄 My Advent of Code solutions

- **2025**: Learning Java  
  - **Day 1, Part 1**: Dial rotation puzzle (count how many times the dial points at 0).  
  - **Day 1, Part 2**: Count every dial rotation that passes 0, step by step.
  - **Day 2, Part 1**: Find invalid gift shop IDs, where numbers made of a repeated sequence of digits twice are invalid.  
  - **Day 2, Part 2**: Find invalid gift shop IDs, where any number made of a repeating sequence at least twice is invalid.
  - **Day 3, Part 1**: Determine the largest possible joltage from each battery bank by turning on exactly two batteries; sum them across all banks.  
  - **Day 3, Part 2**: Determine the largest possible joltage from each battery bank by turning on exactly twelve batteries; sum them across all banks.
  - **Day 4, Part 1**: Count the rolls of paper (@) that a forklift can access (fewer than four rolls in the eight adjacent positions).
  - **Day 4, Part 2**: Repeatedly remove accessible rolls of paper until no more can be removed; count the total number removed.
  - **Day 5, Part 1**: Determine how many available ingredient IDs are fresh by checking each ID against the fresh ID ranges.
  - **Day 5, Part 2**: Merge overlapping or touching fresh ID ranges and count how many unique ingredient IDs are considered fresh.
