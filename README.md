  - **Day 6**
    - Part 1: Read each homework problem *left-to-right*, where each problem is a block of columns separated by a blank column. Each block contains several multi-digit numbers (one per row) and an operator (`+` or `*`) on the last row. Parse the block, evaluate it, and add the result to the total.
    - Part 2: Read each homework problem *column-by-column*, where each column contains a vertical number, and the operator (`+` or `*`) is on the bottom row. Each column represents one number; evaluate the operation across all columns in that block.
